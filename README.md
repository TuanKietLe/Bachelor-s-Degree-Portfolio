## Project Objective
This project is dedicated to study about how **ESP 32 WROOM microcontroller** works. More specific, this project aims to study how to use the WiFi mode of the ESP 32, how they communicate to each other through that module. Furthermore, this project also improves my PCB design skill. The expected outcomes of this project are:
*understanding how ESP 32 works to communicate,
*being able to combine electrical components such as motor driver, motors, ultrasonic sensors, joysticks, switches,
*designing PCB board for the car's controller,
